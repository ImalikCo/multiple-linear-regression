MLR is a technique that can be used to model a linear relationship between one or more independent variables and one dependent variable. 
The goal is to create a linear formula that can predict the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variables. 
Although MLR can be used for both classification and regression, as the name implies; it is mainly used for regression.
